# Yossh-Coding-Challenge

This is as far as I could get in the time limit. Currrently, I have a basic main page and the beginning of a "See Expenses" page as well as
pieces of the backend. I believe this does not accurately represent my level of proficiency as a programmer.

After creating basic classes for Expense and Date, I spent around 45 minutes struggling to link my Eclipse project to Github. This loss
of time heavily affected my ability to write functional code. Also, when I wrote "General" on the original page, I did not realize I was
going to be expected to do frontend as well as backend. While I can do both somewhat proficiently, I cannot do both in this kind of time
constraint. I think my biggest weakness was working on the frontend. I spent most of my time focussing on the frontend just because I was
going at such a slow pace trying to figure everything out.

If possible, I would very much appreciate a second opportunity to show my coding skills that focuses more on backend programming which is 
where I now realize is my strength. 

I know I can do better than what I am submitting today.
